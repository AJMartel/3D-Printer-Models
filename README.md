## Tablet Keyboard Stand

This is a tablet stand that is designed to clip onto an inexpensive, easy-to-find Bluetooth keyboard.  You can find information on the keyboard and learn about the design process on my website.

## FiiO E07K Andes USB DAC Mount

This is my desk mount for my FiiO E07K Andes USB DAC.  It has a dependency on the "rounded box" function from the [MCAD library][2].

# Keychain Connector for USB Flash Drives

This is an adapter for attaching any standard USB flash drive to a KeySmart
keychain, but it should work just fine with any old keychain, too.

My friend Brian is using this to attach his USB 3 flash drive to his
KeySmart, and it is working great. The connector prints slightly loose for
his flash drive, but is too tight for most of the USB cables I have here. You
may need to scale it down a bit before printing.
