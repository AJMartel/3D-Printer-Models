## Tablet Keyboard Stand

This is a tablet stand that is designed to clip onto an inexpensive, easy-to-find Bluetooth keyboard.  You can find information on the keyboard and learn about the design process on my website.

## FiiO E07K Andes USB DAC Mount

This is my desk mount for my FiiO E07K Andes USB DAC.  It has a dependency on the "rounded box" function from the [MCAD library][2].

## Speaker and AC Adapter Bracket

This is a pair of brackets to attach my Altec Lansing VS2421 speakers and my QNIX QX2710 AC Adapters directly to my articulating monitor arms.  They're simple S-shaped brackets that are held in place by gravity.  Each pair of brackets requires a single M3 screw to attach to the speaker's keyhole slot.

These brackets are pretty specific to my hardware, but the OpenSCAD source should be easy enough to modify for other purposes.
