# Keychain Connector for USB Flash Drives

This is an adapter for attaching any standard USB flash drive to a KeySmart keychain, but it should work just fine with any old keychain, too.

My friend Brian is using this to attach his USB 3 flash drive to his KeySmart, and it is working great. The connector prints slightly loose for his flash drive, but is too tight for most of the USB cables I have here. You may need to scale it down a bit before printing.
